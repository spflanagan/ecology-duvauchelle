# ecology-duvauchelle
Analysis of community and population ecology in a seagrass bed in Duvauchelle.
All data required to reproduce these analyses are archived ![on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6800784#.YsUk73ZBxPY).

The appropriate workflow is:
1. docs/dataCleaning.Rmd
2. docs/dataSummary.Rmd
3. docs/communityAnalysis.Rmd
4. docs/populationAnalyses.Rmd

This repository also contains modified scripts for hierDiversity, which currently should be used by reading in all code using `source()` in R.
